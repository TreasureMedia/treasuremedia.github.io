Amidst the grand and fiery battles of South Africa’s fight against apartheid, the spotlight has often missed the everyday warriors—those whose courage unfolded in small homes and in the quiet corners of their communities. Asa Salie (née Van Der Fort) was one such person, a woman whose life was defined by sacrifice, resilience, and a boundless love for her people. Her journey was not marked by iconic photographs or grand speeches, but rather by the perseverance of a mother, a community leader, and a fighter whose resolve never wavered in the face of an unjust system. A system that, after 30 years of democracy, is still unjust.
Asa Van Der Fort was born into a South Africa that saw her as lesser—not because of her abilities, but simply because of the colour of her skin. Growing up in the bustling streets of Cape Town, Asa quickly learned the lessons that apartheid taught every child born under its oppressive rule. She saw how her parents struggled to provide for their family, how opportunities that seemed so readily available to others were closed off to them. But Asa, instead of accepting this fate, turned her frustration into action.
The 1960s were turbulent years, and by 1980 the time Asa was a young woman, married, with children who would soon grow up in this same unjust system. She understood that she couldn’t simply watch as her children might be faced with the same barriers she had encountered. This determination to ensure a better future for her children and her community pushed Asa into the very heart of the awareness, for her children to empower themselves with education. 
Asa’s journey began in her local community District Six, where forced removals changedthe landscape of Cape Town. The government’s bulldozers rolled through neighbourhoods, reducing homes to rubble and dreams to dust. Asa herself had experienced the heartbreak of being uprooted, her family evicted from District Six as part of the Group Areas Act’s merciless campaign to “cleanse” prime areas for white settlement. For Asa, it wasn’t just about the loss of a physical space—it was the erasure of a history, a community, and a sense of belonging. When she returned to District Six in 2011, she vowed that she would work, with her neighbours, to try and bring back the heart of District Six.
These removals sparked in Asa a fierce resolve. She became deeply involved in local initiatives, working tirelessly within her community, engaging with Administrators of CPUT, to give back to the District Six community of which this university takes up over 52% of the land, where people were bulldozed from. This all started in 2013 when only 114 units were built and people of District Six could return to. People who had returned needed to build again a community that was lost.
To date in 2024, sadly to say, there are only 247 families from 1300 families who lodged claims to return to District Six. There are still over 5000 unverified claims to return to the District Six that boasted a vibrant community that once was.
When apartheid finally fell, and Nelson Mandela walked free, Asa, like so many others, watched with tears streaming down her face. The joy was overwhelming, but it was also bittersweet. She thought of the many friends who had not lived to see this day, of the countless sacrifices made. Freedom had come, but at such a high cost. Yet, as she stood among the cheering crowds, Asa knew it had all been worth it. Her children would now grow up in a country where they were not judged by the colour of their skin, where they had opportunities, she could only have dreamed of as a child.
In the years that followed, Asa continued to work within her community. She focused on education, understanding that the fight was far from over—true freedom, she believed, would only come with opportunity and knowledge. She worked with local schools.
Asa Salie’s story is not one of fame or great recognition. It is the story of countless South African women who fought against a brutal regime not for glory, but for love—for their children, for their families, and for a better future. Asa was a mother, an activist, a protector, and an unsung hero whose legacy lives on in the streets of Cape Town and in the hearts of all those who knew her. She involves herself with community and its people.
Her life reminds us that the struggle against apartheid was fought not just in grand halls and political arenas but in the kitchens, in the homes, and in the hearts of women like Asa—women who refused to accept that their children would grow up in chains, who fought with everything they had for the simple right to be free, free that only education could give them. An education that is far from where it has to be but with perseverance it will get there.
