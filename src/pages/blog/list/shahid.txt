Shahid Khan's journey, like many others who stood up against the apartheid regime in South Africa, is a testament to resilience, courage, and the unwavering belief in justice. Born in Cape Town, South Africa, Khan grew up in the Bantwal neighborhood, where he continues to reside today. His path to activism began in his youth, shaped by personal experiences of apartheid’s brutal and unjust system, which deeply ingrained in him a lifelong commitment to fighting for the rights of the oppressed.
 Khan’s first brush with apartheid’s stark racial divide came during a family holiday to Durban. He recalls an incident at the beach, where his family was ordered out of the water by an Indian constable because they were on a “whites-only” beach. As a child, Khan couldn't comprehend why the color of his skin barred him from swimming in the same water as white families, whose dogs were freely playing in the sea. This moment planted the seeds of activism, igniting a deep sense of injustice that would stay with him throughout his life. He questioned why people of color were treated as second-class citizens, often worse than animals, and this realization fueled his desire to fight for equality.
It wasn’t until high school that Khan began actively participating in the anti-apartheid movement. He joined the Student Representative Council (SRC) and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the chairperson. His leadership extended beyond his school, as he helped form the Bantwal Inter-Student Congress (BISCO), a coalition of students from various schools aimed at uniting youth in the struggle against apartheid.
As Khan’s political awareness grew, so did his involvement. He joined several organizations, including the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Muslim Students Association (MSA). His religious beliefs played a significant role in shaping his activism. Khan believed that religion had a place in the fight against apartheid, particularly in raising awareness among the Muslim community, which he felt was economically better off but largely disconnected from the harsh realities faced by their African neighbors in Langa and Gugulethu. His engagement with the Call of Islam, a movement that framed the struggle against apartheid within an Islamic context, was instrumental in mobilizing Muslims to participate in the fight for justice.
Khan’s activism didn’t come without personal sacrifice. Like many involved in the anti-apartheid movement, he faced significant risks. One of the defining moments in his life was the 1986 Trojan Horse massacre in Cape Town, where security forces opened fire on protesters, killing several young activists. The loss of his friends, such as Ashley Kriel and Colin Williams, hit hard. These tragic events only deepened Khan’s resolve to continue the struggle, despite the ever-present dangers.
Khan was also arrested during a student meeting, along with 40 other students. They were detained for a weekend, and the experience highlighted the oppressive tactics used by the apartheid regime to suppress dissent. Yet, the student movement in Cape Town, including areas like Papago and Bishop Lavis, continued to resist, carrying the torch of activism forward.
Khan’s involvement in the struggle came at a high cost to his family life. His mother, fearful for his safety, once burned his textbooks, mistakenly believing they were political materials that could incriminate him. His brother was also arrested and detained without trial for two weeks simply for carrying pamphlets distributed at a mosque. Khan himself had to spend many nights away from home, hiding in safe houses to avoid arrest.
Despite the toll the struggle took on his family, they understood and supported his fight for liberation. His faith played a crucial role in sustaining him during this time, as the teachings of the Quran emphasized justice and the fight against oppression. For Khan, the anti-apartheid struggle was not just a political battle but also a moral and religious duty.
The end of apartheid in 1994 brought mixed feelings for Khan. While he was pleased that the country had transitioned to democracy, he was deeply disappointed by the persistent inequality and the failure of the government to fully deliver on the promises of the struggle. Khan felt that while political freedom had been achieved, economic freedom remained elusive. The wealth accumulated by white South Africans during apartheid still gave them significant advantages, and many black South Africans continued to live in poverty.
Khan is particularly critical of the corruption that has plagued the post-apartheid government. He believes that many politicians have prioritized personal gain over the well-being of the people, undermining the goals of the anti-apartheid movement. He acknowledges that while there have been improvements in access to education and healthcare, the system remains unequal, with wealthier South Africans benefiting far more than the poor.
Though no longer involved in party politics, Khan remains active in his community, focusing on youth development. He works with organizations that provide opportunities for young people to escape the cycle of poverty through sports and education. One such initiative is a cycling program, where Khan and others take young people from Bantwal and surrounding areas to participate in events like the Cape Town Cycle Tour. For many of these youngsters, it’s their first time leaving their neighbourhoods, and the experience is transformative.
Khan’s commitment to empowering the next generation extends beyond sports. He is passionate about educating young people about the history of the anti-apartheid struggle, urging them to understand the sacrifices made for their freedom and to take up the mantle of activism in their own lives. He believes that while the political landscape has changed, the struggle for justice and equality is far from over.
As someone who lived through the harshest years of apartheid, Khan’s message to the younger generation is clear: “Don’t let your circumstances determine your ability to achieve.” He stresses the importance of understanding the past, learning from it, and using that knowledge to fight for a better future. He laments that many young people today are disconnected from the struggle, not fully appreciating the freedoms they now enjoy or the responsibility they have to continue pushing for change.
For Khan, the fight against apartheid was never just about ending a racist system—it was about building a just and equal society for all. While South Africa has come a long way since the dark days of apartheid, Khan believes that the country still has a long way to go before the ideals of the Freedom Charter are fully realized. Until then, he remains committed to his lifelong cause, continuing to inspire those around him to fight for a fairer, more equitable South Africa.
