Julian Stubbs was born in 1968 in the Cape Flats, an area in South Africa marked by racial segregation under apartheid. Raised in the neighbourhood of Lansdowne, Stubbs lived through a time of escalating political tension in the 1980s, particularly in the Western Cape, where student protests and anti-apartheid rallies became a prominent feature of daily life.
Despite growing up in a middle-class environment with limited political activism at his schools, Stubbs' consciousness of the socio-political climate grew as he progressed through his education. He attended Oak Ridge Primary and South Peninsula High, where the rising tension around apartheid led him to become increasingly involved in anti-apartheid protests. Reflecting on his upbringing, Stubbs recalls the blatant segregation and discrimination that shaped his early years—segregated buses, trains, and public spaces marked a clear divide in society.
Stubbs' journey into the liberation struggle was marked by a natural inclination toward justice. From a youthful age, he felt compelled to stand up for the oppressed. He recalls a memory from his childhood when he defended a younger boy being teased for a physical disability, which would later translate into his stance against apartheid. “I always felt that I needed to stand up for people,” Stubbs explains. As he became more politically aware, this sense of justice aligned with his involvement in protests against the apartheid regime.
In 1985, Stubbs' life changed dramatically. On October 15th, he was arrested during a protest in Cape Town. Though a spectator at the time, the security police rounded him up along with several others, charging them with public violence. The arrest led to a year-long sentence in Pollsmoor Prison, a period Stubbs describes as “stolen” not just from him, but also from his family, who endured the pain of his absence. The charge was fabricated, a consequence of the apartheid government’s heavy-handed approach to suppressing dissent.
For Stubbs, that arrest and imprisonment remain defining moments in his life. He reflects on the personal toll it took on him and his family, as well as the broader impact it had on shaping his perspective of the apartheid regime. His story is one of many during a time when countless South Africans faced similar injustices under a government determined to maintain its grip on power.
After the end of apartheid, Stubbs observed the new challenges that arose in post-apartheid South Africa. He notes the initial optimism under Nelson Mandela's leadership and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), but his view of subsequent governments is far less favourable. He believes that successive administrations failed to address systemic issues like poverty, corruption, and education, expressing frustration that the promises made to uplift the poor have not been fulfilled. "You go back to 1994 and look at townships like Khayelitsha and Guguletu," he says, "and you go there now and see if there's any difference."
Today, Stubbs leads a quieter life, focusing on his family and work, but his passion for justice remains. He continues to engage in small acts of kindness and charity, though he has distanced himself from direct political activism. Now 56 years old, he channels his efforts into supporting local initiatives and encouraging younger generations to get involved in their communities. His advice to the youth is clear: “Get involved physically, not virtually,” urging them to take part in tangible, community-focused actions rather than relying solely on social media to express their activism.
Stubbs’ story is one of resilience, shaped by the fight against apartheid and the ongoing struggles of a post-apartheid South Africa. His life journey reflects the enduring impact of a history marked by both personal and national transformation. His words offer a reminder that the fight for justice is never over, and that each generation has a role to play in shaping the future.
