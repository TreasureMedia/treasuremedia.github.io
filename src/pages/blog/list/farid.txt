Farid Sayed's childhood was one shaped by the harsh realities of apartheid South Africa, a time when racial segregation was rigidly enforced, and the lives of those classified as 'coloured' were marked by systemic inequality and social injustice. Born in 1954, Farid's early life was a microcosm of the broader struggles faced by millions under apartheid, particularly those who, like him, occupied the precarious position between the black and white communities.
Farid was born in a small place, Pinfontein, outside Benoni, in what is now East Rand in Gauteng, surrounded by institutions that were off-limits to people like him. "Directly opposite us was a church, a high school, and a primary school, reserved only for whites," he recalls in his interview with Reem Amhed. This early exposure to segregation began to shape his understanding of the world, even if he didn’t fully grasp its implications at the time.
His family moved to Cape Town in 1962 when Farid was in Grade 2. The move to a 'proper school' did little to alleviate the feeling of being an outsider. Farid explains, "I couldn't go to a particular school that was directly opposite me. I had to go to a school where one teacher had to teach all classrooms." It wasn’t until a few years later that he began to comprehend the full extent of this discrimination, when, as a child, he was separated from his peers based on his racial classification.
One day at school, Farid experienced an incident that would leave a lasting impact on him. An inspector came to the school and segregated the students based on their racial classification. "All the children who are classified coloured and Malay, please stand on one side," the inspector ordered. Farid, following his cousin, stood on the side for coloureds, only to be told he belonged with the Indians. "It was laughable, but it was also hurtful and damaging," he reflects, noting how these early experiences of racial classification sowed seeds of confusion and resentment.
It was during his high school years that Farid's political consciousness began to develop, catalysed by the pervasive injustice he witnessed and experienced. The apartheid government's policies were not only a source of frustration but also a call to action. "There was an occasion, maybe around Grade 4 or so, when I realised, I was being classified. These small incidents started to build up a picture of what the system was all about."
Farid's activism was nurtured by his environment and the people around him. His family had connections with the Pan Africanist Congress, and he would often hear stories about the struggles and sacrifices made by his relatives. These stories, along with the mentorship of influential figures like James Matthews, a writer and activist, fuelled his desire to fight against the oppressive system. "We started putting pressure on the school and realised there were teachers on our side. They just needed a catalyst," he says, recalling his early efforts to resist apartheid's injustices.
Another profound influence on Farid's life was Imam Abdullah Harun, a respected figure in the Muslim community and an anti-apartheid activist. Imam Harun, through his actions and teachings, demonstrated the importance of standing up for justice. Farid remembers him not just for his political stance, but for the way he treated others with kindness and respect. "He was a very funny person, always teasing us as youngsters. But we then got to learn about him as a person who was deeply committed to the fight for justice," Farid shares.
Imam Harun’s work with the Muslim community and his opposition to apartheid made him a target for the government, leading to his detention and eventual death in custody in 1969. Initially ,the apartheid-era government claimed he died from falling down a flight of stairs however ,a reopened inquest in 2023 found that he actually died as a result of torture by the police .Farid believes that Imam Harun was detained not for any specific crime but because of the threat he posed to the apartheid regime. "He was detained in order to remove him from creating a society that would continue that legacy of struggle," Farid asserts.
Growing up coloured during apartheid was an experience marked by daily encounters with systemic discrimination, but it was also a period that shaped Farid Sayed into a resilient and determined individual. His early life experiences, from the injustice he witnessed to the mentorship he received, forged in him a deep commitment to fighting for justice and equality, a commitment that has defined his life and work ever since.
