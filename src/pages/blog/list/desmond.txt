In the pages of South Africa’s history, countless names are immortalized in tales of the struggle against apartheid. Yet, some remain unsung forgotten by the public but not by those who walked alongside them. Desmond Solomon “Solly” Gordon, known simply as “Solly” in his community, was one such hero. His journey was not chronicled in textbooks, nor was his face on television, but his sacrifices left an indelible mark on the fight for freedom.
Born in the heart of a township, Solly grew up on the dusty streets of Perth Street, on the corner of First Street and Seventh Avenue. The community around him was a vibrant mix of hardship and resilience. It was there, as a young boy, that Solly witnessed the harsh realities of apartheid firsthand. “I was just a thirteen-year-old boy when I first felt it,” he recalled, his voice tinged with a haunting nostalgia. Life was a daily struggle—a combination of limited opportunities, systemic racism, and trying to make sense of an unjust world.
Solly’s path into the liberation struggle began in the most ordinary way—through school. As a teenager, he found himself part of a student movement, one that would change the course of his life forever. He spoke of the day his school erupted in protest, with students tearing down apartheid flags, a powerful act of defiance against a regime that saw them as less than human. “We turned all the apartheid flags, and the Indian flag. That was when my enrolment in the struggle started,” he said.
But as ordinary teenagers wielded stones against armed vehicles, Solly quickly learned that the journey for freedom was dangerous and unforgiving. “The whole school was surrounded by security forces. They were shooting at us, and we went through many marches after that,” Solly said, his voice still carrying the fear and adrenaline of those moments. Despite the risks, he and his peers remained defiant, refusing to bow to the fear that the apartheid forces tried to instil in them.
One incident that stood out vividly in Solly’s memory was a protest march where a young boy from Cape Town was killed. “He was just a child,” Solly remembered, his voice trailing off. The boy had thrown a stone, which hit a white student from Stellenbosch, who died instantly. In that moment, the brutal price of rebellion became glaringly clear to Solly—innocence had no place in the crossfire of apartheid, and freedom was an aspiration paid for in lives.
Despite the turmoil outside, the struggle was very much a part of Solly’s home life. His parents, though fearful, understood why their son chose this path. Solly was raised by his mother alone after his father passed away, and it was this strong maternal influence that kept him grounded, even when life became almost unbearable. Solly recounted the terror of having his house raided by the authorities, in search of firearms or anything that could implicate him further. “They were looking for weapons, but they found nothing,” he said, his voice steady—a quiet defiance against those who had sought to break him.
After the historic elections of 1994, many believed that the sacrifices had finally borne fruit, that the new South Africa would be one of opportunity and justice for all. But for Solly, the transition to democracy brought its own set of challenges. He remembered the arrests, the torture under Section 29, and the endless court battles. Life after 1994, for those who fought for freedom, was not always the dream they envisioned. “We still had challenges—basic things like electricity and water were not available to everyone,” Solly reflected. It was not just the fight against apartheid but the fight against inequality that continued, and Solly remained involved in community activism, demanding fair access to basic resources.
In his later years, Solly became an advocate for the youth, focusing on the challenges of education in the townships. He spoke passionately about the dropout rates in schools and how the cycle of poverty and lack of opportunity continued to plague the young. “We have a lot of dropouts in our schools,” he said, frustration lacing his voice. “These kids need opportunities, they need hope.” For Solly, the struggle had always been about hope—about giving future generations the chance to live without the fear and discrimination that had defined his youth.
Solly’s message to the next generation is clear: the fight is not over. The legacy of apartheid may have ended on paper, but the scars it left behind still run deep in the fabric of society. Solly believes that the youth today are the true carriers of the torch, that they must continue the fight not with stones, but with knowledge, resilience, and unity.
Desmond Solomon “Solly” Gordon may not be a household name, but his story is that of many—one of resilience, bravery, and an unwavering belief in justice. His life reminds us that while statues and textbooks may honour the well-known figures, the true spirit of the struggle lives on in the hearts of those like Solly, whose sacrifices shaped the freedom we experience today. He is an unsung hero, a forgotten flame, but a beacon of hope, nonetheless.
