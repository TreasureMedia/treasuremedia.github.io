Zelda Ann Hintsa’s life is a tapestry woven with threads of resistance, pain, love, and resilience. Born on June 13, 1958, in the harsh reality of apartheid South Africa, her story reflects the journey of many who fought for liberation. Today, well into her 60s, Zelda sits back and reflects on a life shaped by activism, community, and the timeless African philosophy of Ubuntu—“I am because we are.”
“I’ve been through the rough road,” Zelda begins, her voice carrying the weight of experience. “And when I said, no, now it's going to stop, I have to heal and mend myself.” Zelda speaks with the wisdom of someone who has walked the long path to freedom and emerged on the other side, not unscathed, but determined to find peace. She pauses before adding, almost as an afterthought, “I even started to play the guitar for my personal use.”
But Zelda's journey began in much different circumstances, growing up in the apartheid-era townships of South Africa. Her mother worked as a domestic worker, and her father was a seaman on submarines, spending long stretches away from home. Zelda and her brother were left in the care of their aunt in Bonneville, a working-class community in Cape Town. Later, the family moved to Athlone, a township with deep ties to the liberation struggle.
“My roots are between Bonneville and Athlone,” Zelda explains, adding that her early life was marked by the injustice and segregation that defined apartheid. “In 1976, I just started high school when everything was disrupted.” That year, the Soweto Uprising erupted, as students protested against the imposition of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in schools. Zelda, like many others, was thrust into the political struggle without fully understanding what was happening around her.
It was a history teacher, the late Alan Liebenberg, who opened her eyes to the deeper currents of South African history. “He came into the class one day and said, ‘I’m going to teach you real history, not the history they want me to teach you.’” Zelda's voice softens as she recalls how this moment changed her life. Liebenberg’s lessons on the liberation struggle sparked something in her, a sense of purpose that would carry her through the dangerous and uncertain years ahead.
Zelda soon became involved in youth activism. She describes how she and her fellow students would sneak out of school to attend political meetings, despite the ever-present threat of police violence. “It was very difficult, very scary,” she admits, but there was a camaraderie among the students, a shared understanding that they were part of something larger than themselves. “We would make plans as to how we were going to safeguard each other. Where do we escape to if trouble starts?”
The spirit of resistance was not confined to Zelda’s school life. Her mother played a role in the struggle as well, cooking meals for activists and quietly supporting the movement. “My mom, she taught me what Ubuntu is,” Zelda says, recalling how her mother’s selflessness and generosity shaped her own understanding of community. “Ubuntu is worrying about the person outside…to protect each other.”
This sense of Ubuntu, of shared humanity, became a guiding principle for Zelda, not just in her activism but in her personal life as well. She speaks with warmth about her mentors—figures like Dula Omar and Issa Musa—who helped her navigate the complexities of the struggle. From Omar, she learned to think strategically, to look beyond the surface and understand the broader picture. From Musa, she gained practical skills in civic organization and leadership, learning how to draft constitutions and put issues on the table with clarity and determination.
Zelda’s activism was not confined to rallies or protests. She was deeply involved in interfaith work, recognizing that the struggle for liberation was also a spiritual and moral one. “Even as faith-based, it’s worrying about the person outside that you’re also in a struggle with,” she reflects, highlighting the intersection between faith and activism in her life.
Despite her deep involvement, Zelda was never detained or arrested—though she faced constant harassment from the apartheid police. “I wasn’t detained, but I was harassed,” she says, recalling the racial slurs and threats that were hurled at her because of her dark skin. “They used to call me a kaffir… It is painful.”
Zelda’s voice grows heavy when asked about post-apartheid South Africa. “ANC has killed themselves,” she says, expressing her disillusionment with the political direction of the country. For her, the coalition between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Democratic Alliance (DA) feels like a betrayal of the ideals that so many had fought for. “It felt for me as if we were sold out.”
Her disappointment extends to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which she feels failed to hold apartheid-era perpetrators accountable. “Those killers didn’t pay for their crimes,” she says, her frustration palpable. For Zelda, true healing for the country can only come when justice is fully realized for the victims of apartheid.
Yet, despite her disillusionment, Zelda remains committed to the principles that guided her throughout her life. She continues to march, to speak out, and to pass on her knowledge to the younger generation. “We need to write down our histories,” she insists. “Because if I look at my mom's years… she was really the person that taught me Ubuntu.”
Zelda’s story is one of quiet strength. It is a story of a woman who fought not with guns or violence, but with love, community, and an unwavering belief in the power of Ubuntu. Her life is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the enduring hope that, despite the setbacks, true liberation is still possible.
As our conversation draws to a close, Zelda offers a final reflection: “Something happens in front of you, my dad would say, look broader… It’s that look deeper.” In those words lies the essence of Zelda Ann Hintsa’s journey—a life spent looking beyond the immediate, searching always for the deeper truths, and never losing sight of the humanity that connects us all.
