South Africa’s fight against apartheid is often remembered through iconic figures, speeches, and triumphant moments. However, the true essence of the struggle lies in the countless untold stories of people like Dehran Swart—those who fought tirelessly, often without recognition or reward. Dehran’s journey is a testament to the grit and resilience of those who gave everything for justice, only to find themselves grappling with the very society they helped liberate.
Born in Weinberg, Cape Town, in 1962, Dehran grew up under the oppressive shadow of apartheid. The environment of his childhood was far from ideal—it was a place where everyday life was marred by segregation and fear, but also a profound sense of community. Dehran’s parents instilled in him a sense of social and political awareness. His father was a teacher, and Dehran witnessed firsthand the injustices that apartheid inflicted upon his family and community. His parents had been forced out of District Six, a thriving community that was dismantled by apartheid’s brutal forced removals. Dehran’s mother’s father lost his house in this process, a personal tragedy that echoed the wider dismantling of Black and Coloured communities across the country.
Dehran’s involvement in the struggle wasn’t a decision he made lightly; it was a culmination of experiences that defined his youth. The streets were battlegrounds, and the classroom was often an extension of this. “I had to either get a lift to the school or take a train, and the trains were all segregated in those years,” Dehran recalled. This experience of systemic discrimination, even in something as mundane as commuting to school, left a lasting impression on him. His journey from a fully integrated school in Zambia—where he spent part of his childhood—to a segregated South African school was jarring, serving as an early awakening to the harsh reality of apartheid.
One of the most defining moments of his life came in 1976, during the aftermath of the Soweto Uprising. His father was arrested for assisting injured students who were fleeing police violence. The authorities saw his compassion as a threat, and he was brutally beaten, detained, and thrown into a police van. Dehran was just a teenager then, but the memory of his father’s glasses being broken and the brutality of his arrest stayed with him. “We felt the brutality of the system at a very young age,” Dehran said.
The 1980s were a particularly turbulent period in Dehran’s life. After finishing school, he joined the University of Cape Town (UCT), where he faced further discrimination, having to apply for special permission to study at what was then a predominantly white institution. During his time at UCT, Dehran joined various student movements, becoming actively involved in the liberation struggle. He joined the Cape Youth Congress and other ANC-aligned organisations, dedicating himself to the fight against apartheid. His activism, however, made him a target. In 1985, while teaching at Alexander Sinton High School, he witnessed police repeatedly raid the school, and he himself was detained alongside his father and over 170 others during a mass arrest.
These arrests were not without consequence. Dehran remembered seeing his father being manhandled, pushed, and shoved in the courtyard of the police station. “I shouted at the police, and all I could say was ‘leave him alone, he’s my father,’” Dehran recalled, his voice still carrying the weight of that memory. It was a period marked by fear, uncertainty, and unimaginable resilience. The fear of not knowing whether a family member would return after being taken by the police was a constant burden. In 1986, Dehran’s brother, just 18 years old, went into exile to avoid arrest and a potential five-year prison sentence for public violence—charges that were often based on the flimsiest of evidence, like throwing a stone during a protest.
Dehran’s own encounters with the apartheid state were harrowing. He spent almost a year in detention, experiencing solitary confinement and witnessing unspeakable horrors, including the brutal assault of a young detainee by police. The trauma of those experiences left lasting scars. After being released, he struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and it took months before he could return to teaching. “I still have flashbacks,” Dehran admitted. The memories of those who suffered, particularly the powerless, remained etched in his mind.
Despite the sacrifices, the South Africa that emerged after 1994 was not the dream Dehran and his comrades had fought for. “Those who were selflessly involved in the struggle took a back seat, thinking everything would be done right,” Dehran reflected, his voice heavy with a mixture of disappointment and hope. He spoke of the disparity between the ideals of the struggle and the reality of contemporary South Africa, where inequality persists, and the wealth gap has widened. The activists who fought for justice had, in many cases, stepped aside, only for career politicians and opportunists to fill the void, leading to widespread disillusionment. “What has actually changed for those living in informal settlements?” Dehran asked, his question highlighting the unfulfilled promises of the post-apartheid era.
Today, Dehran’s fight continues, though it has taken on a different form. He no longer protests in the streets or attends rallies. Instead, he has become a quiet but powerful force within his community. He works at UCT, involved in youth development projects aimed at improving educational prospects and career opportunities for young people. He serves as the chairperson of the Victoria Hospital Facility Board and heads the Dr. Abdullah Abdurahman Medical Bursary Trust. “I try to make a difference where I am,” Dehran said, explaining his ongoing commitment to active citizenship. He may no longer be on the front lines of political activism, but his passion for justice remains undiminished.
Dehran Swart’s story is not just about the past; it is a call to action for the present. His life serves as a reminder that the fight for justice is ongoing, that freedom is not just the absence of oppression but the presence of opportunity and equality for all. His message to South Africans is clear: “We all have to be active citizens. Everyone can make a difference if we all focus on not only our own needs but also on helping the less fortunate.”
In a country still struggling with the legacies of its past, Dehran’s words are both a challenge and a beacon of hope. His journey from a young boy walking segregated streets to a community leader fighting for the future of South Africa’s youth is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. Dehran Swart may not be a name found in history books, but his impact—quiet, steady, and powerful—will forever be felt by those who come after him.
