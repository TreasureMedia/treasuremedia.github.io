Mansoor Jaffer, born in Wynberg in 1959, is a prominent figure in South Africa's history of resistance against apartheid. Growing up in a politically charged environment with his parents, Hassan and Rahmat, and five siblings, Jaffer’ s early experiences shaped his activism and commitment to social justice. He now resides with his wife, Kei Duran, and their two children, Michelle and Arsten, aged 37 and 34 respectively.
Jaffer's education took him through Wynberg and Deep River, where he nurtured interests in sports and music alongside his academic pursuits. His formative years were marked by an awareness of the injustices wrought by apartheid, leading to a lifelong commitment to activism and journalism.
The turning point in Jaffer's political consciousness came with significant events that shook the nation. The murder of Imam Harun in 1969, a victim of the apartheid regime's brutal detention practices, deeply affected him. This was followed by the 1976 student uprisings, which served as a stark reminder of the oppressive regime's impact on youth and education. However, it was the detention of his sister, Zubaida, in 1980 that brought the struggle into his family’s living room, turning theoretical discussions into urgent calls to action.
Initially, Jaffer’s activism focused on media and community organizing. He played a crucial role in establishing civic and youth organizations aimed at resistance against apartheid. His work included significant contributions to resistance newspapers like Grassroots and Samson, both of which faced severe repression from the state. Journalists were often targeted; some were arrested, while others faced violence from security forces.
Jaffer's involvement went beyond journalism. He maintained connections with the political and military underground, contributing primarily to logistical and communication efforts. However, this activism came at a cost. He was detained multiple times under oppressive laws, including the Internal Security Act, and during the state of emergency in 1985. Living under the constant threat of arrest, Jaffer often found himself in hiding, moving between secret locations to evade the security police.
Among the many significant events Jaffer experienced, the 1985 Polls March stands out. Organized to demand the release of Nelson Mandela, the march faced a violent crackdown by the state, resulting in numerous injuries and arrests. This incident was a stark reminder of the regime’s brutality and further galvanized activists.
Jaffer recalls the deep sense of solidarity he experienced while in prison, where connections formed with fellow comrades became lifelines of support. He also highlights the collective struggles and sacrifices made by countless individuals—many of whom remain unsung heroes of the anti-apartheid movement.
Throughout his activism, Jaffer collaborated with many notable figures in the resistance. He remembers working alongside the late Justice Minister, various civic leaders, and many grassroots activists who were pivotal in the fight against apartheid. Each of these individuals played a role in shaping the movement and Jaffa's own understanding of justice and equality.
While he acknowledges the importance of well-known figures in the struggle, Jaffer emphasizes the significance of those who fought tirelessly without recognition. Their collective efforts contributed to a rich tapestry of resistance that ultimately led to the dismantling of apartheid.
In Jaffer's household, political discourse was common. His parents, although initially cautious due to the risks involved, gradually became active participants in the struggle. This environment fostered open discussions about the injustices of apartheid, encouraging Jaffer and his siblings to engage in activism. His mother even participated in marches during her later years, demonstrating the generational commitment to the cause.
Reflecting on the apartheid years, Jaffer notes that more robust participation and global isolation of the apartheid regime could have hastened freedom and reduced suffering. He believes that the legacy of apartheid still lingers in contemporary South Africa, with many socio-economic issues remaining unresolved.
The negotiated settlement that ended apartheid, while historic, did not fully dismantle the old power structures. Jaffer expresses concern about the ongoing disparities in wealth and land ownership, which still predominantly favor white males. The high levels of unemployment and inequality in South Africa today are stark reminders of the unfinished business of the past.
Despite the challenges, Jaffer recognizes the strides made since the end of apartheid. The establishment of a democratic system, freedom of expression, and increased access to public facilities represent significant progress. However, he emphasizes that economic rights remain a pressing issue, urging the need for a deeper examination of inequality and accessibility.
As South Africa grapples with its complex legacy, Jaffer encourages the youth to engage actively in political processes. He believes that fostering a sense of common citizenship, and transcending racial and socio-economic divides, is vital for building a united future.
Currently, Jaffer is focused on promoting arts and culture through the Tate Cultural Collective, an organization he co-founded 17 years ago. The collective aims to unify communities through music, dance, and poetry, fostering personal and collective development. Jaffer’s commitment to uplifting young people through the arts highlights his belief in the transformative power of culture.
As for his legacy, Jaffer expresses a desire not for personal remembrance, but for a society that embodies peace, equality, and justice. He hopes to be remembered as someone who stood firmly for these values throughout his life.
Mansoor Jaffer's journey reflects the resilience and tenacity of those who fought against apartheid. His life story serves as a testament to the power of activism and the ongoing quest for equality in South Africa. As the nation continues to navigate its complex history, Jaffer's insights and experiences remind us of the importance of collective effort in striving for a just and equitable society. His message to the youth is clear: engage, unite, and continue the journey toward a better future for all South Africans.
