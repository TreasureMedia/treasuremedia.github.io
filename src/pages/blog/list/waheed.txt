Waheed Sookol was born in Cape Town in 1968 and embodies the spirit of resilience and activism shaped by the struggles of apartheid South Africa. Now he a 56-year-old father of two, Sookool reflects on his lifetime experiences, his role in the battle against segregation, and his hopes for a better future for South Africa.
Growing up in the suburb of Wynberg, Sookool experienced firsthand the unjust structure of the apartheid regime. The forced removals from District Six left deep impressions on his young mind. As he reminisces about those days, he recalls visiting displaced families, witnessing the harsh realities of racial segregation, and grappling with a profound awakening to the politics of his era.
Sookool’s political consciousness truly emerged in 1976 when his sister participated in a school march that turned violent. The experience marked the beginning of a lifelong commitment to activism. By the time he reached high school, he was deeply engaged in various student movements. In 1983, he became a prominent member of the Muslim Students Association, which became his platform for advocating against the injustices of apartheid.
During the mid-'80s, a series of nationwide boycotts and protests flared across South Africa, highlighting the brutality of apartheid. Sookool was at the forefront of these movements, often organizing protests at his high school. They protest as liberating yet perilous, recalling moments when police would disperse crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets. Despite the turmoil, he found solace and support from peers who shared a vision for a liberated South Africa.
During growing unrest, Sookool’s activism became more pronounced, culminating in his election as Chairperson of the Student Representative Council in 1984. He vividly remembers the challenges of inspiring his peers while navigating the largely repressive environment imposed by the apartheid regime. It was during this period that he also faced arrest, a rite of passage many activists experienced, which only fuelled his resolve.
After matriculating in 1986 despite disruptions, he attended the University of Cape Town (UCT), where he continued to engage in activism. However, the exhilaration of old was tempered by a sobering reality, the struggle for freedom was far from over, and the complexity surrounding post-apartheid society necessitated a deeper understanding of democracy and governance. 
Sookool's experiences have provided priceless lessons about leadership and accountability. He champions active civic engagement, holding that true change emerges from collective grassroots efforts rather than solely from political party directives. Reflecting on South Africa’s democracy today, he stresses the importance of revisiting the principles enshrined in the Constitution, emphasizing legislation that prioritizes human rights and community welfare. He believes these are crucial in overcoming the stagnation and corruption that threatens the nascent democracy.
As a seasoned activist, Sookool urges the youth of today to recognize their potential for change. He encourages them to embrace values of empathy, honesty, and commitment to communal success. “Your happiness and my happiness are intertwined,” he reflects, imparting the message that collaborative growth forms the foundation of a prosperous society.
In an echo of the past, Sookool  carries a message of hope and optimism for South Africa’s future, fueled by the lessons learned through the struggle. As he moves forward, he hopes to be remembered not just as an activist but as a friend and advocate of justice, someone who stood steadfastly for what is right and never wavered in the face of adversity.
