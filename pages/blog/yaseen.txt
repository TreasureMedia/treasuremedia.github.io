In the annals of South Africa’s storied struggle against apartheid, many iconic figures come to mind: Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, and Desmond Tutu, to name a few. Yet, lurking in the shadows of these high-profile personalities are countless unsung heroes whose contributions were pivotal to the movement but remain largely unrecognized. One such individual is Yaseen Mohamed, a Struggle veteran from the Northern Cape whose relentless fight for justice and equality exemplifies the spirit of resilience that characterized the anti-apartheid struggle.
Early Life and Activism
Yaseen Mohamed was born in Northern Cape in 1947. Railway junction town DR which was split into two. On the other side was privileged people and on the other side was less privileged people where blacks and a very few Indians were found. He grew up witnessing the stark inequalities of life under apartheid. When he was only 11, Mr Mohamed became involved in local movements, motivated by the blatant injustices he and his community faced daily. He joined the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) while still in high school, galvanizing his peers around issues of education, land rights, and labour exploitation. However, his name would rarely appear in the media, overshadowed by more prominent leaders.
“I’ve met Sobukwe before his death , I met him in his last days of his life, When he came to Groote Schuur hospital  , we were not allowed to see him but we were smuggled in , When we were about to leave he called us back and said His favourite last words I shall never forget “my friend whenever you leave a company make sure you leave as a good friend , that I shall never” Mr Mohamed said while highlighting his moment meeting Robert Sobukwe and his last words to him.
When he was in Grade 11, he had to leave his hometown DR, where he worked with his uncle in the scrapyard. He met and talked to a lot of black people who convinced him to join the PAC, he joined even though his family was against politics. He joined the PAC despite being told that there was no place for an Indian in the PAC. He was motivated to join the PAC without fear by being born in Africa. “My family was the first family to join the PAC as nonblack people, some were members of the ANC, some were members of the PAC, there was always a debate on which party is right.” He said while speaking about his family and other Indian people who were members of the PAC.
The Legacy of Yaseen Mohamed 
As South Africa transitioned to democracy in the early 1990s, many activists reaped the rewards of their sacrifices, often celebrated and memorialized. Mr Yaseen Mohamed returned to his hometown, where he continued his mission of uplifting his community. Although he was never bestowed with the recognition that many of his counterparts received, his impact is evident in the lives she touched and transformed.

He has been instrumental in fostering community dialogues focused on social justice, equity, and inclusion. As of 2024 he still talks passionately about the history of South Africa.
