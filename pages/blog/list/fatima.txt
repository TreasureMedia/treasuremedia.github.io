Fatima Pandy's journey into activism began at a young age, a result of growing up in a family deeply involved in the fight against apartheid. Surrounded by politically active older sisters, it was almost inevitable that she would find herself drawn into the struggle for freedom in South Africa. As a young girl, Pandy was swept up in the tide of activism, becoming a key figure in youth movements that played a significant role in the anti-apartheid struggle. Her life story, marked by political courage, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to justice, serves as a testament to the power of youth leadership in the broader liberation movement.
Fatima Pandy’s initiation into politics began as a family affair. Her older sisters were already deeply entrenched in political organizations, and from a young age, she found herself attending branch meetings, not because of any grand plans but out of necessity. Pandy recalls that they needed a quorum of eight people to hold branch meetings, and when they couldn't find enough people, her sisters would bring her along, even though she was only about 11 or 12 years old. This early exposure to political life shaped her views and gave her a sense of responsibility toward the broader struggle for freedom.
Despite her young age, Pandy quickly became integrated into the movement. While initially, her involvement might have seemed incidental, it became clear that her future lay in activism. Her experiences attending these meetings alongside seasoned activists laid the foundation for her understanding of the apartheid system and the fight against it.
By the time Fatima Pandy was a teenager, she was fully immersed in the anti-apartheid movement. Alongside her peers, she helped establish youth organizations in her local community. However, this was not always an easy task. Pandy recalls the difficulties of mobilizing people at first, explaining that forming a youth branch was difficult because they couldn’t even gather 12 people. Yet, the group’s persistence paid off, and they eventually formed a youth movement that became a crucial part of the broader resistance.
What stands out in Pandy's recollections of those early days is the unique blend of seriousness and joy in their activism. The youth leaders of the time understood the need to meet young people where they were, engaging them through activities that balanced political consciousness with fun. From game nights to beach trips, the youth movement found creative ways to keep young people involved without making them feel overwhelmed by the weight of the struggle. It was an approach that kept the spirit of the movement alive, despite the dangers and hardships that came with opposing the apartheid regime.
Pandy and her peers also received a thorough political education. They were taught the works of political philosophers like Lenin, Marx, and Gramsci, alongside the history of their own struggle and the labor movement. These lessons equipped them with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, such as how to chair meetings, take minutes, and organize effectively. It was a comprehensive education that prepared Pandy and others like her for leadership roles in the movement.
While the youth movement was a place of learning and camaraderie, the realities of apartheid were ever-present. Fatima Pandy's activism exposed her to the violence and repression that the apartheid state inflicted on those who opposed it. One particularly harrowing experience she recalls is attending the funeral of a group of activists who had been ambushed and killed. To attend the funeral, Pandy and other activists slept in the townships, where local people welcomed them into their homes. Despite their efforts, the police stopped them from reaching the graveyard, underscoring the constant presence of state repression.
Another poignant memory is the funeral of Ashley Kriel, a young activist whose death marked a turning point for many in the movement. Once again, the police intervened, attempting to prevent the mourners from paying their respects. Pandy recalls being strip-searched by the police, an experience that highlighted the lengths to which the apartheid regime would go to suppress dissent. However, she was fortunate to escape with the help of white comrades who shielded her from further mistreatment.
The brutality of apartheid was not limited to police harassment. Pandy recounts a particularly traumatic experience in Johannesburg, where the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) launched an attack on people in the hostels. She had just gotten out of a taxi when she saw people being mowed down. The memory of stepping over bodies that day left a lasting impression on her, a stark reminder of the cost of the struggle for freedom.
As the political landscape became more repressive, Pandy and her comrades had to find new ways to organize. Many organizations, including the United Democratic Front (UDF), were banned by the apartheid government. In response, Pandy and others formed the Western Cape Students Congress (WEXCO). To avoid further bans, they strategically avoided using the word "congress" in their title, opting for "council" instead. This allowed them to continue their work without drawing the same level of attention from the authorities.
In her role as treasurer of WEXCO, Pandy was responsible for managing not just the organization's finances but also its overall operations. However, as she explains, being a treasurer in those days meant much more than just handling money—it meant being an organizer, a coordinator, and a key figure in ensuring the safety of fellow activists. Pandy and her comrades developed a system of safe houses for those who needed to go underground, relying on people who were less visible in the struggle to provide shelter and support.
Despite the constant threat of arrest and repression, the movement continued to grow. Pandy’s local youth organization evolved from the Cape Youth Congress (CACO) to the South African Youth Congress (SAYCO), eventually becoming part of the ANC Youth League. The fight against apartheid had shifted from a local struggle to a national movement, and Pandy was right in the middle of it.
One of the challenges that Pandy and her peers faced was finding safe spaces to hold meetings and organize. While universities like the University of the Western Cape (UWC) were hotbeds of political activity, they were also heavily surveilled by the authorities. Protests at UWC often led to arrests, making it difficult to organize large gatherings there. Instead, many meetings were held at the University of Cape Town (UCT), which, though predominantly white, offered a relatively safer environment for organizing.
Despite these challenges, Pandy and her comrades never wavered in their commitment to the cause. They continued to meet, plan, and resist, knowing that every step they took brought them closer to the goal of a free and democratic South Africa.
