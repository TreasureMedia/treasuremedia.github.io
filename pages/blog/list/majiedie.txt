Majiedie Abrahams, born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, is one of many unsung heroes of the anti-apartheid struggle. His life has been shaped by the fight for freedom, justice, and equality in a country once defined by racial segregation and oppression. From his early days as a youth activist to his current reflections on post-apartheid South Africa, Abrahams' story is one of resilience, commitment, and, above all, a desire to see a just and fair society. Today, as he looks at the state of the nation he fought for, Abraham holds a mix of pride, disappointment, and hope for the future.
Majiedie Abrahams grew up in Cape Town in the 1967a time when apartheid was at its peak. Like many others, he experienced firsthand the harsh realities of a system that discriminated against people of colour, relegating them to second-class citizenship. Living in a community that was oppressed, Abraham’s political awakening came early in life.
Inspired by the leaders and local activists, Abrahams began to get involved in political activities as a teenager. His introduction to activism was like that of many young South Africans at the time—through organizing and participating in youth movements that opposed apartheid. In high school, he joined the local branch of the Congress of South African Students (COSAS), an organization that sought to mobilize young people against the regime.
Abrahams and his peers worked tirelessly to educate fellow students about the oppressive laws of apartheid, organizing protests and demonstrations whenever they could. These were dangerous times, and young activists like Abrahams were frequently arrested, harassed, or even tortured by the police. But despite the dangers, he remained committed to the cause, knowing that they were fighting for something much bigger than themselves—the liberation of their country.
For Majiedie Abrahams, one of the most defining aspects of the anti-apartheid struggle was the role of young people. As he often reflects, it was the youth who brought energy and urgency to the fight. "We knew we had to act. We were young, but we weren’t naïve. We saw the injustice in our communities, and we understood that if we didn’t stand up, nothing would change," Abrahams recalls.
One of the key events that shaped his activism was the Soweto Uprising of 1976, when thousands of black students protested against the enforcement of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in schools. The brutal response from the apartheid regime, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of students, solidified Abrahams’ resolve to continue the fight. "What happened in Soweto was a turning point for many of us. It showed us how cruel the regime was, but it also inspired us to fight harder," he explains.
Over the years, Abrahams continued to work with various youth organizations, helping to organize protests, distribute political pamphlets, and participate in underground meetings. His activism extended beyond just local efforts; he became involved with the ANC’s underground structures, helping to mobilize support for the broader liberation movement.
The end of apartheid in 1994 was a moment of triumph not just for Majiedie Abrahams but for millions of South Africans who had fought for decades to see their country freed from the shackles of racial segregation. The election of Nelson Mandela as South Africa’s first black president marked the beginning of a new chapter in the country’s history.
For Abrahams, this was a time of immense pride and celebration. "I remember the day Mandela was inaugurated. It was as if the world had shifted. We were finally free, and it felt like anything was possible," he recalls.
As the country transitioned into a democracy, Abrahams, like many others, believed that this was the beginning of a brighter future for South Africa. The new government, led by the ANC, promised to address the inequalities of the past, rebuild the economy, and provide equal opportunities for all South Africans.
However, in the years that followed, Majiedie Abrahams, like many of his fellow activists, began to grapple with the realities of post-apartheid South Africa. While the end of apartheid marked the fall of institutionalized racism, many of the socio-economic inequalities that had plagued the country during apartheid remained.
Today, Abrahams looks at South Africa with a mix of emotions—pride for the progress made, but also deep concern for the challenges that continue to hinder the nation’s potential.
One of his biggest frustrations is the ongoing issue of corruption within the government. "We fought so hard for this country, and to see corruption take root in the very institutions we fought to create is heartbreaking," he says. The ANC, the party that led the liberation struggle, has been plagued by scandals in recent years, and Abrahams believes that this has eroded the public’s trust in the government. "Corruption isn’t just about stealing money—it’s about stealing the future of our children, of our communities. It’s something that we can’t afford to tolerate."
Economic inequality is another major issue that Abrahams is deeply concerned about. While apartheid may have ended, the wealth gap in South Africa remains stark, with millions of people still living in poverty. "The struggle wasn’t just about political freedom. It was about economic justice, about ensuring that everyone in this country has a fair shot at a decent life," Abrahams explains. He worries that the promises of the liberation movement have not been fully realized for many South Africans, particularly the poor and marginalized.
Despite his frustrations with the state of the nation, Majiedie Abrahams remains hopeful for South Africa’s future. He believes that the country’s problems can be addressed if the government and society are willing to hold themselves accountable. "We need to go back to the values that guided us during the struggle—integrity, honesty, and a commitment to serving the people. If we can do that, we can still build the South Africa we dreamed of," he says.
For Abrahams, the solution lies in renewing the spirit of activism, particularly among the youth. He sees the new generation as the key to pushing South Africa forward, just as the youth were central to the anti-apartheid struggle. "Our young people need to understand that the fight isn’t over. The struggle now is about building a fair and just society for everyone. They have the power to make that happen."
Majiedie Abrahams’ life has been defined by his commitment to justice and equality. From his days as a young activist fighting against apartheid to his reflections on the current state of South Africa, he has remained steadfast in his belief that a better future is possible. While he is critical of the government’s failures, particularly in addressing corruption and inequality, Abrahams is not without hope. He believes that with accountability, integrity, and a renewed spirit of activism, South Africa can still realize the dreams of those who fought for its freedom.
tIn his own words, "We didn’t fight for nothing. The dream of a free, equal, and just South Africa is still alive—it’s up to us to make it a reality."
