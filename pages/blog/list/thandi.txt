In the annals of history, the stories of female veterans often remain shrouded in silence, overshadowed by their male counterparts. Yet, these women the resilient figures of the apartheid struggle in South Africa have fought not only for their freedom but also for the rights and dignity of their communities. They are the unsung heroines whose sacrifices and determination have paved the way for future generations. 
One such remarkable woman is Henriette Thandi Abrahams, whose journey from a small town to the frontline of activism reveals the indomitable spirit of those who refused to remain silent in the face of oppression. Born and raised in  Bonteheuwel, Henriette's early life was shaped by the political turmoil of apartheid South Africa. As a young girl, she was keenly aware of the injustices that plagued her community. Her father, a Rasta and early activist, instilled in her a sense of social justice that would become the bedrock of her activism.
In the early 1980s, the fires of resistance began to burn brightly in South Africa. As a student at Bonteheuwel  High, she found herself drawn into the world of student politics. By 1983, she was involved with the School Representative Council (SRC), where she met fellow activists who would become her comrades in the struggle for justice. Henriette was arrested after she got her December results for grade 9 which was known as standard 9 back in the day after that her passion for activism ignited as she witnessed the harsh realities of apartheid, fueling her desire to mobilize her peers and challenge the oppressive regime.
Henriette's journey was fraught with danger. As a leader, she faced constant threats from the authorities, enduring harassment, detainment, and even imprisonment. Yet, her spirit remained unbroken. The day she received her matric results was also the day she was arrested—an irony that spoke volumes about the cost of her activism. Despite being on the run for years, her commitment to the struggle never wavered. She understood that the fight for freedom was not just about her; it was about her community, her people, and the future of her country.
Henriette’s activism was not a solitary endeavor. The struggle against apartheid was a collective movement, woven together by the experiences and sacrifices of many. Throughout her journey, she bore witness to the loss of friends and fellow activists around the 1980s, men like Ashley Kriel, Coline Williams, and Anton Fransche, who paid the ultimate price for their commitment to justice. These losses became heavy burdens that she carried, propelling her forward with a fierce determination to honor their memories.
During this turmoil, Henriette ‘emerged as a feminist leader, recognizing that women's liberation was integral to the broader fight for justice. She organized the United Women’s Congress, mobilizing women from all walks of life to address issues that affected them directly. Her leadership extended beyond the political sphere; it was a profound act of compassion and solidarity that sought to uplift the voices of those often marginalized in the struggle.
Years after the fall of apartheid, she found herself still deeply entrenched in activism. She recognized that while the political landscape had shifted, the fight for economic freedom and social justice was far from over. The harsh realities of poverty, unemployment, and inequality remained pervasive, particularly for women and marginalized communities.
In her eyes, the promises of liberation had not been fulfilled. Many of the struggles she fought against were still evident in the lives of her people. The high cost of living, unemployment, and lack of basic services continued to plague her community. Henry believed that the new leadership had failed to serve the interests of the poor and that the voices of the youth must rise to demand accountability from those in power.
Today, Henriette ’s message to the youth of South Africa is one of urgency and empowerment. She implores them to organize around their issues, to take charge of their futures, and to reclaim the power that belongs to them. She emphasizes the importance of grassroots movements and collective action, reminding the younger generation that true change comes from the bottom up.
Her call is not merely a plea; it is a battle cry that echoes the sentiments of many who have fought for justice. "Sitting on Twitter and TikTok won’t change your life," she asserts, "You must physically mobilize." Her belief in the power of community and collective action is unwavering. She wants the youth to understand that their voices matter and that they can challenge the status quo and bring about real change.
