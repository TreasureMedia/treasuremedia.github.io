In the annals of South Africa’s history, it is often the quieter voices, the ones that fought in the streets and struggled in silence, that remain unheard. Among those voices was that of Charles “Bubbles” Januarie—a man from Bonteheuwel, Cape Flats, whose story is one of resilience, sacrifice, and an unbreakable spirit. Though his name might not appear in textbooks, his contribution to the liberation struggle and his undying commitment to the community tell a powerful story of courage in the face of brutality.
Growing up in Bonteheuwel, Bubbles lived in a time when apartheid determined every aspect of one’s existence. It dictated where people could live, what schools they could attend, and even what opportunities they could dare to dream of. Yet, for Bubbles, the weight of oppression was not enough to crush his spirit; instead, it forced him into a fighter who would not easily back down.
His journey began at Modderdam High School in 1984, where he first found his voice as a student amidst the chaos of the Cape Flats. The early years were marked by an innocence that would soon be shattered by the harsh realities of the struggle. When 1985 dawned, an opportunity arose for him to attend the South African Jockey Academy in Durban, where he hoped to pursue a career as an apprentice jockey. Bubbles passed the interview and left for Hillcrest, excited to be embarking on a new adventure far from home. However, instead of opportunity, he was met with prejudice. The academy, where he was the only person of colour, became a stark reminder of the racism that was so deeply embedded in South Africa’s institutions. As a person of colour, he faced unrelenting discrimination, his dark complexion marking him as an outsider. It was an experience that exposed him to the harshness of systemic racism in a new way, and when his physical growth rendered him unsuitable for a jockey’s career, he left Durban, returning to the Cape Flats not defeated, but stronger.
Back home, the unrest in the country was reaching a boiling point. The 1985 murders in Uitenhage of the Cradock Four—Matthew Goniwe, Fort Calata, Sparrow Mkhonto, and Sicelo Mhlauli—sparked outrage and ignited mass uprisings across South Africa. It was during this time, as the nation erupted in fury, that Bubbles truly came into his own as a young activist. Just 14 years old, he joined the protests, throwing stones alongside his fellow students. The anger of the injustices he witnessed turned into action, and for him, this was not just about fighting apartheid; it was about standing up for the dignity of his community.
In 1985, Bubbles was arrested for public violence—stone-throwing during a protest—and spent an entire weekend in a police cell, experiencing the cold brutality of the apartheid police force. The experience was terrifying; he was just a child yet found himself locked in with hardened criminals. The arrest left a lasting impact on him. Though he was eventually acquitted after a long year of legal battles, the trauma of his first experience in jail was one that would never leave him. It exposed he not only to the harshness of the apartheid legal system but also to the resilience that existed among those around him.
Despite the fear and the danger, Bubbles continued his activism. He attended secret political discussion groups, drawn to the revolutionary ideas of Marxism, Leninism, Trotskyism, and Black Consciousness. These meetings were his education—a space where he learned to critically engage with the political ideologies that could offer an alternative to the apartheid nightmare. Unlike many households where political talk was forbidden, Bubbles sought the forbidden knowledge that would help him understand the systems of oppression and how to dismantle them. In those underground gatherings, he found purpose, solidarity, and a sense of direction.
One of the most traumatic moments in Bubbles’ life came at a United Democratic Front (UDF) rally in Rocklands, Mitchell’s Plain. He witnessed the brutal killing of a man accused of being an informer—a man he had known from his hometown. The violence of the struggle was laid bare in front of his eyes, forcing him to grapple with the harsh, often contradictory, nature of the fight for liberation. Yet, despite the trauma, Bubbles remained undeterred. He knew that the struggle was not just about ideological battles—it was about survival, about ensuring that future generations would not have to live under the same yoke of oppression.
Throughout the years, Bubbles was deeply involved in various protest actions. He took part in the protest against the English rebel cricket tour led by Mike Gatting at Springbok Park in Kimberley, standing up against those who ignored the cultural boycott of apartheid South Africa. He hoisted the banned ANC flag at political rallies, a dangerous act that could easily have led to her arrest. When Ashley Kriel, a young activist known as the “Che Guevara of the Cape Flats,” was killed, Bubbles attended his funeral, raising the ANC flag in defiance, tears of grief and fury mingling on his face.
His commitment came at a personal cost. In the turbulent years of the struggle, Bubbles spent 14 days in solitary confinement at Pollsmoor Prison, isolated from the world with nothing but his thoughts for company. He was just a teenager yet had already seen and experienced more pain and injustice than many do in a lifetime. After his solitary confinement, he shared a cell with prominent activists such as Ebrahim Rasool, who would later become the first ANC Premier of the Western Cape, and Zolli Malindi. It was in these dark cells that he found light in the form of camaraderie, learning from those who had been in the struggle long before he, gaining a sense of the broader movement of which he was now undeniably a part.
When apartheid finally fell in 1994, Bubbles, like so many others, celebrated the dawn of a new era. Yet, he remained critical, echoing the words of Zubeida Jaffer: “After ‘94, we simply handed power over to the politicians and went on with our ordinary lives.” Bubbles had witnessed how the ANC, once a movement of the people, had begun to falter. The promises of true transformation seemed to fade, replaced by a new kind of power that, to he, felt eerily familiar. The rural schools, still with pit toilets, and children learning under trees, reminded him that the struggle was far from over.
Today, Bubbles has turned his efforts to empowering his community once again. He is a shop steward for CEPPWAWU in the paper and printing sector and was previously a member of NUMSA, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, where he was a Regional Executive Member. He was prominent in advocating for the working class, pushing NUMSA not to support the ANC in the last election but to offer a true alternative for workers. In 2017, he travelled to India on a fact-finding mission to connect with progressive organisations, including the Indian Communist Party and labour unions. The fight for workers’ rights has become his new battlefield, and his passion for justice remains undimmed.
Bubbles is also a pillar of strength in his neighbourhood, serving as the chairperson of the community’s neighbourhood watch and a representative on the ward committee for safety and security. For him, the fight has always been about protecting his community, whether from apartheid police or the more modern dangers of crime and inequality. He believes in the power of unity, famously reminding those around him, “While the old are dying, the new is struggling to be born, and a working class united can never be defeated.”
Charles “Bubbles” Januarie may not be a name known to many, but his story echoes the untold narratives of countless women who gave their all for the fight against apartheid. He fought not for fame, but for the hope of a better future—a future where no child would face the same hardships he endured. Through arrests, protests, and trauma, Bubbles’ resilience has always shone through. Today, he continues to fight, not with stones but with his voice, his influence, and his unwavering belief that a united people can never be defeated. His story is a reminder that the struggle for justice is ongoing, and that true change comes not from waiting but from acting, no matter how daunting the task.
